## Overview

This repository contains the solution for an assignment focused on data processing, error handling, and file handling tasks using Python. The assignment required importing salary data, implementing functions to retrieve employee details, processing data into a dictionary format, and exporting employee details to a CSV file within a zipped folder.

## Thought Process

### Data Import

The first step involved importing the provided salary data into the Python environment. This was necessary to prepare the data for subsequent processing steps.

### Function Development

To handle user queries effectively, a function was developed to retrieve employee details based on their name input. This function utilized pandas for its robust data manipulation capabilities.

### Data Processing

Processing the salary data involved converting it into a structured dictionary format. This transformation aimed to facilitate efficient data access and manipulation throughout the assignment's tasks.

### File Handling

The final task was to export specific employee details into a CSV file. These files were then consolidated and stored within a zipped folder named "Employee Profile," ensuring a structured and organized storage format.

### Using R for Viewing Results

For viewing the extracted details stored in the "Employee Profile" zip folder using R, the process involved extracting the contents and displaying them using Râ€™s file manipulation and reading capabilities.

## Conclusion

This README provides a concise overview of the approach taken to solve the assignment, emphasizing data handling techniques, error management, and file manipulation strategies. It outlines the logical steps followed to achieve the assignment's objectives without delving into specific code implementations.
